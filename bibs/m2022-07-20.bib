	abstract = {The identification of genomic regions affected by selection is one of the most important goals in population genetics. If temporal data are available, allele frequency changes at SNP positions are often used for this purpose. Here we provide a new testing approach that uses haplotype frequencies instead of allele frequencies. With this approach, less multiple testing correction is needed, which leads to tests with higher power, especially when the number of candidate haplotypes is small or moderate. Another advantage is that haplotype frequencies can often be recovered with less noise than SNP frequencies, especially under pool sequencing. For a larger number of haplotypes, we investigate methods to combine them to a moderate number of haplotype subsets. The use of haplotypes also permits a better understanding of selective signatures. For this purpose, we propose post hoc tests for the selected haplotypes and differences between their selection coefficients. Using both simulated and real data sets, we illustrate the performance and benefits of our proposed test statistics.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {With the rapid advances in single-cell profiling technologies, larger-scale investigations that require comparisons of multiple single-cell datasets can lead to novel findings. Specifically, quantifying cell-type-specific responses to different conditions across single-cell datasets could be useful in understanding how the difference in conditions is induced at a cellular level. Here we present a computational pipeline that quantifies the cell-type-specific differences and identifies genes responsible for the differences. We quantify differences observed in a low-dimensional UMAP space as a proxy for the difference present in the high-dimensional space and use SHAP to quantify genes driving the differences. Here we applied our algorithm to the Iris flower dataset, scRNA-seq dataset, and mass cytometry dataset, and demonstrate that it can robustly quantify the cell-type-specific differences and it can also identify genes that are responsible for the differences.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
