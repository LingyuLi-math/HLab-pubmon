  `NeurIPS <https://nips.cc>`_ ...
* and more ...


Guidelines
==========

The motivation is that everyone in the lab has a habit of reading, reasoning 
and sharing, which hopefully will keep us inspired and excited in science. 

The guidelines here only aim to help us make better use of the limited time:

* Please make it within 10 min per person (up to 15min), including discussions.
* Introduce the background sufficiently, so everyone can understand what the 
  question is.
* Don't need to go through the whole paper. Just mention 1 to 3 points that you 
  want to share. It can also be questions that puzzle you.

Ideally, you will find this paper sharing is somewhat like a cake tasting party.
So, bring the nice new cake you find and share why you like it, in an effective
way.
